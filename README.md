# com-pwn-ent-days
Com-PWN-ent days - An event to learn how to PWN web dev w/ components!

## Concept:
- 2 days, during the week, early summer, PGH near CMU/Pit preferrably
- Unconference format w/ anchors
- Anchor talks help bring the group together around central ideas
- Theme for each day which isn't held to but can help get ppl thinking of topics to propose when they show up
  - Day 1 is that the future is bright, vibrant and pluggable because of the "Lego"ing of front end development
  - Day 2 is focused on progressive web apps, application development, and web as compiled into native app environments
  - Think of the difference as "let's focus on the pieces" vs "now let's focus on the sets we can build"

## "Unconference format"
- A facilitator ensures everyone knows the purpose and rules of the engagement (Referee of sorts)
- A template of a schedule is released ahead of time but is blank
- Attendeeds work together the morning of each day to construct the schedule dynamically
- People are free to move between discussions / talks and propose them / update them throughout the day

## "Anchor talk" format:
- The anchor talk are talks designed to bring everyone together to form a common experience in the more traditional presentation / speaking / lecture format
- Anchor talks are intended to ensure attendees get a rich experience and understanding of technologies they may have never used before, as explained by someone who works in that space
- The goal is to expose parallel communities without overlap to one another's concepts, methods and tooling to increase awareness of what's out there
- Background of the library / project / approach
- Pros / Cons of the approach
- Who's doing it
- Examples of the speaker(s) work illustrating it in action
- Demo of the tooling / commands needed to get started
- 1 page white paper
  - Overview of everything above in 1 page
  - Links to project / docs / tooling repos
  - Links to resources to get up and going
  - Link / data about the speakers for connecting after
- Page is handed out physically to people that want it + link to same info on the web
- Goal of the anchor talk is to learn about specific technology to enough detail in order to get started with it or to explain to a team why that technology should be considered for the next project.
